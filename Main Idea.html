    <h1 id='title'>Main Idea, Supporting Ideas, &amp; Details</h1>
    <p>On a reading test, you often see the same question. The question is, "What is the main idea?"</p>
    <p>To understand the main idea, you need to understand the topic. The topic is who or what it is about. You also need to understand the events. The events are what is happening.</p>
    <p>Every sentence in a paragraph communicates an idea.</p>
    <p>All of these sentences become part of a larger idea.</p>
    <p>In other words, these smaller ideas become supporting ideas or details to the main idea of the paragraph.</p>
    <p>A well written paragraph has a main idea, supporting ideas, and detaiks.</p>
    <p>The supporting ideas give more information about the main idea. The details give more information about the supporting ideas</p>
