    <p>On a reading test, you often see the same question. The question is, "What is the main idea?"</p>
    <img src='Idea.png' class='image alignRight'>
    <p>To understand the main idea, you need to understand the topic. The topic is who or what it is about. You also need to understand the events. The events are what is happening.</p>
    <p>Every sentence in a paragraph communicates an idea.</p>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <img src='LargerIdea.png' class='image alignRight'>

    <p>All of these sentences become part of a larger idea.</p>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <p>In other words, these smaller ideas become supporting ideas or details to the main idea of the paragraph.</p>
    <img src='MainIdea.png' class='image alignRight'>
    <p>A well written paragraph has a main idea, supporting ideas, and details.</p>
    <p>The supporting ideas give more information about the main idea. The details give more information about the supporting ideas</p>

    <p>Practice:</p>
    <p>Read this paragraph. What is the main idea?</p>
    <p class='note'>Being a safe driver takes practice. Jordan wants his driver's license now. Some of his friends have driver's licenses. Jordan wants to drive to work. Jordan's father says, "Go to driving school." Jordan doesn't want to go to driving school. He thinks it is too expensive and not necessary. Jordan gets his driver's license and buys a car. He also buys insurance. He is ready to drive to work! Two weeks later, Jordan has a car accident. Jordan is okay, but his car is wrecked. The insurance company tells Jordan, "You are not a safe driver. you must pay more money for insurance. You must also go to driving school. You need more practice."</p>
    <p>First, look at the <strong>topic</strong> sentence. The topic sentence tells the main idea of the paragraph. The topic sentence is at the beginning of the paragraph. It is usually the first sentence, but not always.</p>
    <p class='note'>Being a safe driver takes practice.</p>
    <p>This sentence tells us <strong>what</strong> this is about.</p>
    <p>Next, look at the <strong>concluding</strong> sentence. The concluding sentence is the last sentence of the paragraph. A good concluding sentence retells the main idea. Look at the last sentence:</p>
    <p class='note'>You need more practice.</p>
    <p>Both the topic and concluding sentences have the owrd '<strong>practice</strong>'. We know that '<strong>practice</strong>' is important to the main idea.</p>
