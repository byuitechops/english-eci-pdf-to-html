    <h1>EC 1 Present Progressive</h1>

    <i>Form - How is it formed?</i>

    <p>
      The present progressive is formed by using the present tense of the verb be + the present participle (-ing form) of a verb. Review the examples below.

    I am cooking I 'm camping You, we, they are speaking You, we, they 're studying He, she, it is helping He, she, it 's cooking Meaning- what does it mean? It means that actions are in progress. I am cooking ____________________|_____________________ Past Now Future I am cooking/I'm cooking means I cook now. I am in the process of cooking. Use – when/why is it used? 1. To show that an action is in progress. It started before now, is happening now, and will continue. The workers are painting the house (and they won’t be finished for an hour or two). I’m trying to reach Susan (but for some reason, she doesn’t answer her phone). 2. To show that an action is not finished, even though that action may not be happening exactly at the moment of speaking. I’m reading a good book right now. (It’s next to my bed. I’m on page 203. I expect to finish it next week sometime.) I’m learning to be more patient with children. 3. To show the beginning, progression, or end of an action or change. The leaves are beginning to turn brown. It is becoming more difficult to find out exactly what consumers want. 4. To show a planned activity in the future. This meaning usually shows that the speaker has some control over the action. We’re having a party for John on Saturday. Mike is giving a speech tomorrow on diet and exercise.
