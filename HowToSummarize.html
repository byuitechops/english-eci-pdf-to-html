    <h1 id='title'>What is a Summary?</h1>
    <p>A summary tells the main idea of the storty, the news, a report, or any information. A summary tells the most important facts or ideas. A summary is useful for many things.</p>
    <p>When you introduce yourself, you give a summary. You tell only the facts that people want to hear.</p>
    <p>In a job interview, you talk about your education and work experience.</p>
    <p>With new friends, you can talk about your hobbies and interests.</p>
    <p>If you give too much information, it is not a summary. A summary gives enough information to understand the main idea.</p>
    <h1 class='key'>A summary is short.</h1>
    <p>A summary is much shorter than the original text. If the original text is one paragraph, a good summary is only one or two sentences. If the original text has many paragraphs, a good summary is only one paragraph.</p>
    <h1 class='key'>A summary tells the main idea.</h1>
    <p>A summary also tells important facts and supporting ideas. Titles are useful for understanding the main idea. However, a title is not a summary. A summary uses complete sentences. </p>
    <h1 class='key'>A summary uses different words.</h1>
    <p>A summary uses different words from the original text. When you write a summary, use your own words. Use <strong>synonyms. Synonyms</strong> are different words that have the same meaning.</p>
    <h1>Examples of Synonyms</h1>
    <p>easy = simple</p>
    <p>hard = difficult</p>
    <p>fast = quick</p>
    <p>great = terrific</p>
    <p>Most common words in the English language have synony,s. A thesaurus can help you find good synonyms. <a href='http://wordwebonline.com'>Word Web Online</a> is s useful thesaurus.</p>
    <h2>Summary Warm Up</h2>
    <p>A summary is like describing a picture in one sentence. Look at each picture. Decide what is happening. Write one sentence to describe each picture.</p>

    <h1 class='key'>Steps for writing a good summary</h1>
    <h2>1. Read</h2>
    <p>Read the text. You need to understand the main idea.</p>

    <h2>3. Rewrite</h2>
    <p>Rewrite the most important information in your own words. Include facts and ideas that support the main idea.</p>
    <h1>Practice</h1>
    <h2>Read</h2>

    <h2>Recall</h2>
    <p>Remember as many facts as you can. Don't look at the text.</p>
    <p>Now, look at the text. Look at the topic (beginning) and concluding (final) sentences. What is the main idea?</p>
    <img src='Summary.PNG'>
    <blockquote class='sgnote highlight'>Main Idea: Janet has an important job interview for a job she hopes to get.</blockquote>
    <p>What are the supporting ideas? A T-Chart can help you organize the supporting ideas and details.</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Supporting Idea</th>
                <th>Details</th>

            <td>After the interview. Janet sends a thank you email.</td>
            <td></td>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>To help you start, write just the main idea and the supporting ideas.</p>
    <p class='note'>Main Idea: Janet has an important job interview for a job she hopes to get. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supporting Idea #1: Janet prepares for the interview.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supporting Idea #2: Janet is dressed her best.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supporting Idea #3: The interview goes very well.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supporting Idea #4: After the interview, Janet sends a thank you email.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>Rewrite</h2>
    <p>Remember the keys to writing a summary.</p>
    <h1 class='shortkey'>Short</h1>
    <p>Your summary should be short. The original text is one paragraph, so your summary should be one or two sentences.</p>
    <h1 class='shortkey'>Main Idea</h1>
    <p>Decide which supporting ideas and details are the most important. You don't have to include all of the supporting ideas.</p>
    <h1 class='shortkey'>Different Words</h1>
    <p>Use your own words as much as possible.</p>
    <h3>Sample Summaries</h3>
    <p class='note'>Janet has a good job interview because she prepares well.</p>
    <p class='note'>Janet gets ready for an important job interview. She practices questions and learns about the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;company.</p>
    <p class='note'>Janet wants an important job. She prepares for the interview by practicing.</p>
    <p class='note'>Janet prepares for a job interview. She does very well because she acts professionally.</p>
    <p>All of these sentences are good summaries. The details are different, but the main idea is clear.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>A summary is shorter than the original text. A summary tells the main idea and the most important facts. A summary uses your own words.</p>
