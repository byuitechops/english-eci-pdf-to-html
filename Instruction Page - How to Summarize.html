  <h1>What is a Summary?</h1>

  <p>
    A summary tells the main idea of a story, the news, a report, or any information. A summary tells the most important facts or ideas. A summary is useful for many things.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you introduce yourself, you give a summary. You tell only the facts that people want to hear.
  </p>

  <p>
    With new friends, you can talk about your hobbies and interests.

  <p>
    If you give too much information, it is not a summary. A summary gives enough information to understand the main idea.

    [KEY PICTURE]
    <h2>A summary is short.</h2>
  </p>

  <p>
    A summary is much shorter than the original text. If the original text is one paragraph, a good summary is only one or two sentences. If the original text has many paragraphs, a good summary is only one paragraph.
  </p>

  <p>
    [KEY PICTURE]
    <h2>A summary tells the main idea.</h2>
  </p>

  <p>
    A summary also tells important facts and supporting ideas. Titles are useful for understanding the main idea. However, a title is not a summary. A summary uses complete sentences.
  </p>

  <p>
    [KEY PICTURE]
    <h2>A summary uses different words.</h2>
  </p>

  <p>
    A summary uses different words from the original text. When you write a summary, use your own words. Use <strong>synonyms</strong>. <strong>Synonyms</strong> are different words that have the same meaning.
  </p>

  <p>
    <h2>Examples of Synonyms</h2>
  </p>

  <br> easy = simple
  <br> hard = difficult
  <br> fast = quick
  <br> great = terrific

  <p>
    Most common words in the English language have synonyms. A thesaurus can help you find good synonyms. <a href="http://www.wordwebonline.com" target="_blank">Word Web Online</a> is a useful thesaurus.

    A summary is like describing a picture in one sentence. Look at each picture. Decide what is happening. Write one sentence to describe each picture.
